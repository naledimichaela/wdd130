    <h1>About Me</h1> 
    <img alt="Image of me?" src="images/naledi.jpg">
    <h2>Name: Naledi Michaela Modige</h2>
    <h3>Nickname: Nana</h3>
    <p>Most people call me Mama Bear, you probably wondering where that name comes from right? Well I am a single mother of two beautiful kids, a girl and boy. I am from South Africa, in a city called Pretoria.</p>
    <P>I am a Business Development Manager by profession but decided to try something new, a different industry and do my Bachelor's Degree in Applied Technology.</p>
    <p>I chose to do my degree with BYU-Idaho because not only do I further my studies but I also get a chance to work on my relationship with Heavenly Father and have a strong testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the Book of Mormon. I was born in the church so I've been a member all my life and there is one qoute that I fell in love with which was on the notice board for the longest time. I don't know who wrote the qoute, it says "It's better to choose humility than to be humble because of circumstances." </p>
    <p>My favorite scripture is Moroni 10:5 "And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things. Thank you.</p>
